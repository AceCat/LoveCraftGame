# Project 1: LoveCraftGame

## User Stories

* The game features two interfaces - the first is a text based 'Choose Your Own Adventure' series of choices. Selecting different options will have ramifications for the player character - ranging from teaching him new attacks and giving him new objects to instantly killing him. Certain choices may lead players into a battle at which point the game will shift to a turn based battle. From here players can select different attacks and targets.

* The game is really a balancing act. The player character has his health, but also has a hidden value called sanity. If the player character's health or sanity ever equals zero the game ends. There is currently no benefit to conflict - it's unavoidable, but whenever a person can avoid fighting it's in their best interest to do so.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript/JQuery
* Stunng artwork created using "Piskel"

## What still needs to be done?
The game is perfectly functional in its current state, although the balancing is off. It's currently very difficult to win (which is how I like it, but it's maybe too extreme). There are typos scattered throughout the game.

## What else will be added?
* I'd like to build out a few of the choice trees a little more, especially the final encounter.
* I'd like to implement logic that will level the player character up if he hits a certain amount of experience
* Right now there is no reason to ever kick anything. The health of everything needs to be scaled up and I'd like to change attacks so that they return a semi-randomized damange number that varies between the attacks. Right now you should never kick anything.
* Sanity is invisible right now which is really frustrating, I'd like to add a constant display of how much sanity you have left so you can make more intelligent decisions about when to use magic.
* The writing is.... well. It's not the best. I wrote it very quickly and would like to do a more thorough rewrite to make the game more immersive. Also to fix all the typos.
* The game needs to be made mobile friendly.
